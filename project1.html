    <h1>Chores Mobile Application</h1>
    <p class="subtitle">The goal of this project is to create a mobile app that will help parents encourage their children to do chores using a reward-based method. The app enables parents to create goals, offer rewards, and give children with a visually appealing interface. The design is user-centric, taking into account the demands of the user. </p>

      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <p>
        In-depth information about the characteristics and interests of the user—Laura, a 38-year-old accountant and mother of two—will be included in this project on the creating of user persona. It will also feature several high-fidelity prototypes that show how users will interact with the app for two important tasks. The design choices are supported by well-established design theories and principles, guaranteeing that the chore management app was developed with a comprehensive and user-centric approach.
